            <p>Knack is a beat 'em up platform game developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Studio">Japan Studio</a> and published by Sony Computer Entertainment 
                for the PlayStation 4. The game was released in North America, Europe, and Australia in November 2013, and in 
                Japan in February 2014, where it was available as a bundle with the console.
            </p>
            <p>
                The player navigates the titular character Knack through a series of levels viewed in a fixed camera, 
                third-person-style view. Knack is a living humanoid organism that consists of Relics; a large central Relic is 
                always surrounded by a varying number of smaller Relics. Knack utilizes jumping, dodging, punching, and using 
                enhanced energy-based powers, in order to progress through the colourful environments, which are populated with 
                enemies. The story follows Knack and his creator on a journey to save humankind from a species known as the Goblins. 
                However, one of Knack's creator's former friends goes rogue, and Knack and his allies must stop the antagonist's evil plans.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon release, Knack received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the game's original concept and ideas, but 
                criticized the gameplay, level of difficulty, and story. A sequel, Knack II, was announced at the 2016 PlayStation 
                Experience, and was released in September 2017.

            <p>Knack is a platforming beat 'em up game in which players control the title character, Knack. Game director Mark 
                Cerny describes the gameplay as "a little bit like Crash Bandicoot, and a little bit like Katamari Damacy", with 
                "a touch of God of War in there". Players control Knack through a series of long, linear levels, journeying from 
                start to finish, while battling enemies, such as humans, robots, and vehicles, finding secret hidden objects that 
                give Knack upgrades, climbing, destroying objects, and completing jumping and switch-based puzzles. The perspective 
                in which the game is played is similar to that in the God of War games. Players only control Knack and do not control 
                the camera. The camera follows Knack in a combination of third-person and 2.5D angles.
            </p>
            <p>Players guide Knack through many levels in many different locations. Each location is different and players follow the 
                objectives played out in the story. The environments are brightly coloured, consisting of bright and vibrant greens, 
                oranges, blues, and greys. Locations visited in the game include mineshafts, forests, factories, mansions, gardens, 
                mountains, cities, laboratories, castles, rock formations, and caves. Gameplay is focused on brawling fighting combat 
                and platforming.

            </p>
            <p>Knack is essentially a large Relic which attracts many small Relics to itself to create a living organism. Knack varies 
                in size; he can be the size of a human child when only a few Relics are incorporated around the big Relic, the size of 
                a gorilla when a moderate number of Relics are incorporated, or the size of small skyscrapers when a very large number 
                of Relics are used. Knack has different abilities for each of his states, even though the player primarily utilizes 
                punching, jumping, and dodging abilities; a small Knack jumps higher, moves faster, and is weak, breaking in a small 
                number of hits, while a large Knack can walk over enemies to defeat them, and pick up or break large objects, such as 
                vehicles and buildings. Apart from the Relics, Knack can surround the large central Relic with ice, metal, wood, and 
                other substances. Knack may use the energy absorbed from Sunstones to unleash powerful tornado attacks, shockwaves, 
                and projectiles. Knack gains new abilities from level to level; for example he can lift up and throw cars in his large 
                form, and use specific objects involved in the story. Knack's voice also changes with his size; Knack's voice is 
                nonexistent when in his smallest form, while in his largest form, his voice is deep, loud, and intimidating.

            <hr>
            <p>In a futuristic society, humanity has progressed in technological advances by harvesting the energy from Relics, physical 
                remnants of a lost civilization. Humans are reviled by the primitive Goblin species, who years prior had waged war upon 
                the humans but ended up being driven from their cities and forced to live in the wilds.

            </p>
            <p>After a force of Goblins commandeering tanks overrun a human outpost, the city of Newhaven organizes an expedition to 
                discover how the weaponry was acquired. Explorer Ryder volunteers, joining billionaire industrialist Viktor and his 
                head of security, Katrina. Doctor Vargas demonstrates his creation, Knack, an organism consisting of Relics, able to 
                control his size. Knack, Vargas, and his assistant and Ryder's nephew, Lucas, consequently partake. The group trace the 
                weapons to a goblin fortress. Knack defeats its chief Morgack, who reveals that a goblin named Gundahar gave him the 
                weapons. Viktor double-crosses the others by kidnapping Lucas, forcing Vargas and Knack to follow, while Ryder questions 
                Morgack. Gundahar later arrives, forcing Ryder to escape.

            </p>
            <p>Returning to his palace, Viktor unveils one of many giant relics to Vargas, Knack, and Lucas, intending to use them to 
                usher the world into a new technological revolution. The trio flee Viktor and discover a map of Trogdo Mine that the 
                relics had been unearthed from, illustrating a locked area which contains even larger relics that Viktor believes Knack 
                can access. At the mine, Knack fails to open the door. Viktor and Katrina corner them and have Knack shot, where he 
                falls down a shaft. Knack enters an ancient cavern where he is ejected by creatures known as Guardians and reaches a 
                nearby castle owned by Viktor. Vargas and Lucas are imprisoned in the castle. Ryder tracks and rescues Vargas and Lucas 
                with the help of Knack.

            </p>
            <p>A Goblin army led by Gundahar invades Ryder's hometown of Monte Verde to steal relics. Vargas, Ryder, and Lucas fashion 
                trackers to find the Goblins' main base. Knack forces Gundahar to leave; tracking the goblins, they reach a factory 
                manufacturing weapons. Vargas is met by Charlotte, his former lover whom he had presumed dead 20 years ago when she 
                had fallen into a chasm. She had been found by Gundahar and nursed back to health; in return, she created arms for 
                him to combat rival goblin factions. After Gundahar turned to attacking human settlements, Charlotte stopped production. 
                Ashamed, she refuses to leave with Vargas. Knack destroys the weapon stores, but Gundahar flees and forces Charlotte to 
                repair the armaments or be cast out. Charlotte sends a message to Vargas, begging him to save her.

            </p>
            <p>In the Barren Wastes, following Ryder's prior discovery, the group enter a temple containing a mural of the door within 
                Trogdo Mine; it depicts the key, which resides beneath Obelisk Mountain, but warns of danger beyond the door. Inside 
                Obelisk Mountain, the group are caught by Viktor and Katrina, having bugged Lucas, but Knack blocks them off with a 
                cave-in. Lucas reminds them of the warnings and persuades them to destroy the key, but Katrina takes it using a mech, 
                triggering a volcanic eruption. Knack defeats Katrina, where she falls towards the lava. Viktor prepares to leave with 
                the key on his airship. Ryder sights Katrina lying on some rubble, and stays behind to save her. Vargas, Knack, and 
                Lucas board the airship.

            </p>
            <p>The three presume Ryder dead following an explosion in the mountain. Vargas receives Charlotte's message and sets the 
                airship to fly to the factory. Viktor traps and ejects them, though Knack saves Vargas and Lucas. They reunite with 
                Charlotte and leave in her aircraft. Viktor succeeds in opening the door in Trogdo Mine, revealing an ancient chamber 
                containing an orb, which disintegrates him. Immediately, the area and Guardians emerge from out of the ground. Charlotte's 
                ship is damaged, forcing the group to land, and Knack leaves to confront the orb. It attaches itself to a Guardian, 
                which Knack battles, destroying the orb. The source eradicated, the expanse of stonework recedes underground.

            </p>
            <p>A parade is held for the group in Newhaven, where Knack, Vargas, and Lucas receive medals. As Vargas leads a eulogy 
                for Ryder, Ryder walks through a desert carrying Katrina towards the city.

            </p>

            <hr>
            <p>Knack was envisioned as the PlayStation 4 equivalent of a Crash Bandicoot title. Knack was the first PS4 game shown 
                to the public. Sony Computer Entertainment decided to do this because they wanted to prove that the PS4's launch 
                lineup did not exclusively consist of big-budget first-person shooters. Because of Knack's intentional similarities 
                to the successful Crash Bandicoot series, Sony Computer Entertainment felt it would be a smart business decision to 
                heavily market Knack as an essential PS4 title. However, some critics questioned this decision. 

            </p>
            <p>The initial idea for Knack was that of a character that could find items and add them to his body thus causing him 
                to grow with Cerny explaining "Our initial concept was that Knack would maybe break down a building or a wall, and 
                he’d incorporate the resulting bricks into his body," This, in practice, however did not work well resulting in " a 
                giant amorphous blob of a character." After a year and a half the team realized that the character had to be 
                designed "more intensively." Instead of incorporating random elements into him he would now instead be made of 
                relics which allowed the developers to make a functioning character.

            </p>
            <p>Cerny attempted to target a dual audience with the game attempting to appeal to both core gamers as well as players 
                who "never picked up a controller before in their life," Cerny would later admit that this "may have taken us off 
                in a bit of a wrong direction" noting that in addition to catering to both set of players the game also had to be 
                a launch title for the system. After interviewing Cerny about the sequel Polygon reporter, Colin Campbell 
                came away with the impression that the original was "created under less-than-ideal conditions" 

            </p>
            <p>In wanting to make a "21st Century Crash Bandicoot" Cerny wanted the game to be smaller in scope than other contemporary 
                games at the time. Despite this Cerny realized that audience expectations were different from when the Crash games were 
                developed and that Knack had to be more "complex" adding " Even if the vision is to be in that sort of genre, to try to 
                speak to the nostalgia that people have for the experiences of years gone by, it turns out you need to do five or 10 
                times as much today." In addition to Crash Bandicoot, other influences for the game include Katamari Damacy and God 
                of War.

            </p>
            <p>Despite years of experience in the industry Knack marks the first game which Cerny directed, explaining to website 
                Gamasutra "We didn't have directors back in the day, because if you have a three-person project you don't worry 
                about calling somebody a 'director.'" Cerny initially envisioned himself as taking a more hands off approach 
                intending himself to merely be a producer but as the game grew he found himself becoming more involved eventually 
                becoming the director.

            </p>
            <p>To promote the launch of the game, Sony Computer Entertainment and Japan Studio released a free mobile game called 
                Knack's Quest on November 6, 2013. The game is a tile-matching puzzle game for iOS and Android devices. The game 
                allows connectivity with players' PlayStation Network accounts to unlock special Relics within the main game.

            </p>
            <p>Knack was released in China as Knack's Adventure at the PlayStation 4's launch on March 20, 2015.
